# DevAccel-Meter

Track Your 100× Code Boost

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/your-username/devaccel-meter?style=social)](https://github.com/your-username/devaccel-meter/stargazers)

DevAccel-Meter is a GitHub App and lightweight dashboard that measures the impact of AI coding tools (like GitHub Copilot or Cursor) on developer productivity. It tracks metrics such as the number of AI suggestions accepted, test pass rates, and PR review times, presenting "hours saved" estimates in weekly reports.

## Features

- **AI Suggestion Tracking**: Monitor how many code suggestions from AI tools are accepted by developers
- **Test Pass Rate Analysis**: Track the percentage of autogenerated tests that pass on the first CI run
- **PR Time Metrics**: Measure the time from PR creation to merge, comparing AI-assisted PRs to historical baselines
- **Weekly Dashboard**: Generate a simple report summarizing "hours saved" based on predefined heuristics
- **Export Options**: Export data as CSV or post summaries to Slack/Teams

## Quick Demo

Run the complete demo with one command:

```bash
./demo.sh
```

This will:
1. Install all dependencies
2. Initialize the database with sample data
3. Start the server
4. Provide links to both dashboards

## Manual Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Initialize database with sample data:**
   ```bash
   npm run init-db
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run start-all
   ```
   Or start components separately:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   npm start
   
   # Terminal 2
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js for lightweight scripting and GitHub API integration
- **Data Storage**: SQLite for simplicity in the MVP stage
- **GitHub Integration**: GitHub App to access repository events
- **Frontend/Dashboard**: 
  - Minimal web UI (HTML/CSS/JS) for reports
  - Streamlit dashboard for data visualization
- **APIs**: GitHub's REST API to pull PR and commit data

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/metrics
Retrieve current metrics for the dashboard.

### POST /api/suggestions
Add AI suggestions data.

### POST /api/pr-times
Add PR time metrics.

### POST /api/analyze-repo
Trigger analysis of a GitHub repository (requires GitHub integration).

### GET /api/export/csv
Export current metrics as CSV.

### GET /api/export/slack
Get current metrics formatted for Slack.

## Data Model

### Suggestions Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `repo_id`: Repository identifier
- `suggestion_count`: Number of AI suggestions accepted
- `timestamp`: When the data was recorded

### PR Times Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `repo_id`: Repository identifier
- `pr_number`: Pull request number
- `time_to_merge`: Time to merge in minutes
- `is_accelerated`: Whether the PR was merged faster than average
- `timestamp`: When the data was recorded

### Test Results Table
- `id`: Primary key
- `repo_id`: Repository identifier
- `test_pass_rate`: Percentage of tests that passed
- `timestamp`: When the data was recorded

## Time Savings Calculation

The application estimates time savings using these heuristics:
- Each AI suggestion accepted = 5 minutes saved
- Each accelerated PR (merged in <24 hours) = 30 minutes saved

These values can be adjusted in `config.js`.
